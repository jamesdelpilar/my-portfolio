## Ch.4 Updates

### GitHub Best Practices
Due to learning GitHub best practices, I have implemented branches for the following tasks (I have not deleted in case you wanted to see them). Furthermore, I have added a Kanban board for orginization. Keep in mind I have implemented this in Ch.4 of the project so there may not be much to look at.

I have also decided not to implement branch rules due to being a solo developer on this project. If this was with more than one developer, branch rules and proper PR's would be implemented. This decision can be debatable between developers.

### Typed.js (Third-Party)
Implemented the Type.js library to have animated text.

### Aesthetic

Went for a minimal neutral colour (white, gray, black) palette. I chose this design due to my "philosophy" as a programmer: Don't over complicate code. Keep it simple.
